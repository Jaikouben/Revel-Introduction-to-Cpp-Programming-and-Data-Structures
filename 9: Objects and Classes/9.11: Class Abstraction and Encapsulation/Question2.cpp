/*
Write the implementation (.cpp file) of the Acc2 class of the previous exercise.
The full specification of the class is:
A data member named sum of type int.
A constructor that accepts no parameters. The constructor initializes the data member sum to 0.
A function named getSum that accepts no parameters and returns an int. getSum returns the value of sum.
Donâ€™t include the header file in this exercise, because REVEL assumes that the header and implementation are placed in the same file.
*/

Acc2::Acc2(){sum = 0;}
int Acc2::getSum(){return sum;}

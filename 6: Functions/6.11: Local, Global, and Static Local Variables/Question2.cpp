/*
Write the definition of a function named max that receives an int parameter and returns the largest value that it has been called with so far.
So, if you make these calls to maxï¼šmax(5), max(3), max(12), max(4), the values returned will be (respectively): 5, 5, 12, and 12.
Hint: use a static local variable to track the largest number that has ever been called.
